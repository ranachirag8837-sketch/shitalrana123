# 🎓 Student Result Prediction System (ML + Streamlit)

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts student exam marks using study hours, attendance, internal marks, and assignment score.

The system compares multiple ML models, selects the best-performing algorithm automatically, and also shows a hybrid ensemble prediction.
